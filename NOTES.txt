NOTES ON NEURAWKES

In the neurawkes repository the CTLSTM model N-SM-MPP is
in modules/models, named NeuralHawkesCTLSM
controlled in controllers.py by class

CTLSTM loss function is called in controllers.py on line 399
key in model settings variable is `conttime`


dim_process = dim_model (used interchangeably)

model type CLI argument is --Model
CTLSTM value -> 'conttime'

in train_models.py:
